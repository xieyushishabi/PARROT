conda create -n megatts3-env python=3.9
conda activate megatts3-env
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install specific version of gradio
# If you encounter bugs with pydantic in inference, you should check the version of pydantic and gradio.

**Requirements (for Docker)**
``` sh
# [The Docker version is currently under testing]
# ! You should download the pretrained checkpoint before running the following command
docker build . -t megatts3:latest

# For GPU inference
docker run -it -p 7929:7929 --gpus all -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 megatts3:latest
# For CPU inference
docker run -it -p 7929:7929  megatts3:latest

# Visit http://0.0.0.0:7929/ for gradio.
```


**Model Download**

The pretrained checkpoint can be found at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CidiSqtHgJTBDAHQ746_on_YR0boHDYB?usp=sharing) or [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/MegaTTS3). Please download them and put them to ``./checkpoints/xxx``.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For security issues, we do not upload the parameters of WaveVAE encoder to the above links. You can only use the pre-extracted latents from [link1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QhcHWcy20JfqWjgqZX1YM3I6i9u4oNlr?usp=sharing) for inference. If you want to synthesize speech for speaker A, you need "A.wav" and "A.npy" in the same directory. If you have any questions or suggestions for our model, please email us.
> 
> This project is primarily intended for academic purposes. For academic datasets requiring evaluation, you may upload them to the voice request queue in [link2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gCWL1y_2xu9nIFhUX_OW5MbcFuB7J5Cl?usp=sharing) (within 24s for each clip). After verifying that your uploaded voices are free from safety issues, we will upload their latent files to [link1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QhcHWcy20JfqWjgqZX1YM3I6i9u4oNlr?usp=sharing) as soon as possible.
> 
> In the coming days, we will also prepare and release the latent representations for some common TTS benchmarks.

## Inference
**Command-Line Usage (Standard)**
``` bash
# p_w (intelligibility weight), t_w (similarity weight). Typically, prompt with more noises requires higher p_w and t_w
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tts/infer_cli.py --input_wav 'assets/Chinese_prompt.wav'  --input_text "Âè¶‰∏ÄËæπÁöÑÊ°å‰∏ä,‰∏Ä‰ΩçËØª‰π¶‰∫∫Âó§‰πã‰ª•ÈºªÈÅì,'‰ΩõÂ≠ê‰∏âËóè,Á•ûÂ≠êÁáïÂ∞èÈ±ºÊòØ‰ªÄ‰πàÊ†∑ÁöÑ‰∫∫Áâ©,ÊùéÂÆ∂ÁöÑÈÇ£‰∏™ÊùéÂ≠êÂ§úÂ¶Ç‰Ωï‰∏é‰ªñ‰ª¨Áõ∏ÊèêÂπ∂ËÆ∫Ôºü'" --output_dir ./gen

# As long as audio volume and pronunciation are appropriate, increasing --t_w within reasonable ranges (2.0~5.0)
# will increase the generated speech's expressiveness and similarity (especially for some emotional cases).
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tts/infer_cli.py --input_wav 'assets/English_prompt.wav' --input_text 'As his long promised tariff threat turned into reality this week, top human advisers began fielding a wave of calls from business leaders, particularly in the automotive sector, along with lawmakers who were sounding the alarm.' --output_dir ./gen --p_w 2.0 --t_w 3.0
```
**Command-Line Usage (for TTS with Accents)**
``` bash
# When p_w (intelligibility weight) ‚âà 1.0, the generated audio closely retains the speaker‚Äôs original accent. As p_w increases, it shifts toward standard pronunciation. 
# t_w (similarity weight) is typically set 0‚Äì3 points higher than p_w for optimal results.
# Useful for accented TTS or solving the accent problems in cross-lingual TTS.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tts/infer_cli.py --input_wav 'assets/English_prompt.wav' --input_text 'ËøôÊòØ‰∏ÄÊù°ÊúâÂè£Èü≥ÁöÑÈü≥È¢ë„ÄÇ' --output_dir ./gen --p_w 1.0 --t_w 3.0

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tts/infer_cli.py --input_wav 'assets/English_prompt.wav' --input_text 'ËøôÊù°Èü≥È¢ëÁöÑÂèëÈü≥Ê†áÂáÜ‰∏Ä‰∫õ‰∫ÜÂêóÔºü' --output_dir ./gen --p_w 2.5 --t_w 2.5
```

**Web UI Usage**
``` bash
# We also support cpu inference, but it may take about 30 seconds (for 10 inference steps).
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tts/gradio_api.py
```

## Submodules
> [!TIP]
> In addition to TTS, some submodules in this project may also have additional usages.
> See ``./tts/frontend_fuction.py`` and ``./tts/infer_cli.py`` for example code.

### Aligner
**Description:** a robust speech-text aligner model trained using pseudo-labels generated by a large number of MFA expert models.

**Usage**: 1) Prepare the finetuning dataset for our model; 2) Filter the large-scale speech dataset (if the aligner fails to align a certain speech clip, it is likely to be noisy); 3) Phoneme recognition; 4) Speech segmentation.

### Graphme-to-Phoneme Model
**Description:** a Qwen2.5-0.5B model finetuned for robust graphme-to-phoneme conversion.

**Usage**: Graphme-to-phoneme conversion.

### WaveVAE
**Description:** a strong waveform VAE that can compress 24 kHz speeche into 25 Hz acoustic latent and reconstruct the original wave almost losslessly.

**Usage:** 1) Acoustic latents can provide a more compact and discriminative training target for speech synthesis models compared to mel-spectrograms, accelerating convergence; 2) Used as acoustic latents for voice conversion; 3) High-quality vocoder.

## Citation
This repo contains forced-align version of `Sparse Alignment Enhanced Latent Diffusion Transformer for Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis` and the WavVAE is mainly based on `Wavtokenizer: an efficient acoustic discrete codec tokenizer for audio language modeling`. Compared to the model described in paper, the repository includes additional models. These models not only enhance the stability and cloning capabilities of the algorithm but can also be independently utilized to serve a wider range of scenarios.
